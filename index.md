I am Aaditya Prakash Kattekola, currently a final year undergrade student in the Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology, Warangal (NITW)](https://www.nitw.ac.in). 

I am seeking to obtain a PhD. I am interested in applications of **control and learning algorithms in the field of Robotics.** If you wish to chat with me, I am looking forward to it.


### Coursework

Being part of one of the top engineering colleges of the country, I had the opportunity to learn many advanced courses and concepts:

* Mathematics
  * Multivariate Differential & Integral Calculus
  * Linear Algebra
  * Various Transformation Techniques (Laplace, Fourier, Z, etc..)
  * Complex Analysis
  * Probability & Statistics.
* Control Systems
  * Mathematical Modelling of Systems
  * Time Response Analysis
  * Root Locus Method
  * State Space Modelling
  * Frequency Response Analysis
    * Bode Plots

### Research Endeavours

* I began my research journey began under [Dr. Suman Niranjan](https://facultyinfo.unt.edu/faculty-profile?profile=sn0301) in the field of Operations Research. In this project, I was responsible for the simulation and network optimization of the COVID19 Cold Chain in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
* I got connected with [Dr. Kamesh Namuduri](https://facultyinfo.unt.edu/faculty-profile?profile=kn0100) when I visited University of North Texas, Denton. I am presently collaborating with him on an traffic management system for an autonomous drone network.
* In my home institute, I worked under [Dr. Sreehari Rao Patri](https://wsdc.nitw.ac.in/facultynew/facultyprofile/id/16301) on Flapping-Wing Micro Aerial Vehicles. A paper titled, _Localization Methods for FWMAVs for Smart Pollination_ got _accepted as a WIP poster_ in the IEEE International Symposium on Smart Electronic Systems (iSES), Dec 2022, Warangal, India.
* As part of my final year project, I am analysing the performance of NOMA networks when aided by Intelligent Reflective Surfaces and UAVs. This project is guided by [Dr. S. Anuradha](https://wsdc.nitw.ac.in/facultynew/facultyprofile/id/16306).

### Extra-Cirricular

* In my first two years of college, I worked at [GBit Studios](https://gbitstudios.com/about-us/). Here I gained a lot of experience on the corporate culture through the lens of a startup. I made & released a basketball inspired called "Net-It" during my time here.

### Responsibilities

* I am also the Club President of the [Robotics Club, NITW](https://roboticsclubnitw.github.io). As part of being the president, I lead our team into robotic competitions, most notable of which is ABURobocon 2023. We are currently making two ring throwing robots that can "Cast Flowers over Angkor Wat".

### Hobbies
In my free time, I play chess. I am always open to a good match on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/AadityaP)
