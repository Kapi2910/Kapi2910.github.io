I am a PhD student, at University of California, Santa Barbara, USA. Previously, I obtained my Bachelors from the [National Institute of Technology, Warangal (NITW)](https://www.nitw.ac.in) in the Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering with Prof Matthew J. Clarkson at WEISS (Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences), University College London (UCL), UK. Before that, I worked with Prof Adrien Bartoli at EnCoV, UniversiteÃÅ Clermont Auvergne, France. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science supervised by Prof Niloy J. Mitra at Smart Geometry Processing Group, UCL.

 I am interested in **Wireless Communication and Robotics.** If you wish to chat with me, just drop me a mail.

### Research Endeavours

* I got connected with [Dr. Kamesh Namuduri](https://facultyinfo.unt.edu/faculty-profile?profile=kn0100) when I visited University of North Texas, Denton. I am presently collaborating with him on an traffic management system for an autonomous drone network.

* As part of my final year project, I am analysing the performance of NOMA networks when aided by Intelligent Reflective Surfaces and UAVs. This project is guided by [Dr. S. Anuradha](https://wsdc.nitw.ac.in/facultynew/facultyprofile/id/16306).

* In my home institute, I worked under [Dr. Sreehari Rao Patri](https://wsdc.nitw.ac.in/facultynew/facultyprofile/id/16301) on Flapping-Wing Micro Aerial Vehicles. A paper titled, _Localization Methods for FWMAVs for Smart Pollination_ got _accepted as a WIP poster_ in the IEEE International Symposium on Smart Electronic Systems (iSES), Dec 2022, Warangal, India.

* I began my research journey began under [Dr. Suman Niranjan](https://facultyinfo.unt.edu/faculty-profile?profile=sn0301) in the field of Operations Research. In this project, I was responsible for the simulation and network optimization of the COVID19 Cold Chain in the state of Madhya Pradesh.

### Hobbies

In my free time, I play chess. I am always open to a good match on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/AadityaP)
